Project Overview:
This project aimed to build a machine learning model to predict the approval status of loan applications based on applicant data. Using a structured dataset of loan applications, we performed preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.

Key Contributions:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared raw data by handling missing values using statistical imputation techniques such as mode and median filling.

Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Loan_ID) that did not contribute to the prediction task.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized key data distributions and relationships using Plotly for insights into approval rates, gender distribution, marital status, and other categorical factors influencing loan approvals.

Used pie charts and bar plots to display categorical feature distributions and class balance.

Model Development:

Built and trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

Applied standard scaling to numerical features to improve model convergence.

Impact:
Enabled data-driven decision-making for loan application evaluations.

Helped simulate real-world classification use-cases in finance/banking domains.

Demonstrated proficiency in end-to-end ML workflow including data handling, visualization, and supervised learning.
